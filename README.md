# Yeast Cell Segmentation with Generalist Deep Neural Network Mediar-Former 

## Data preparation:

1. Training Dataset:
   906 yeast cell microscopy images with labels, provided by Prof. Sahand Jamal Rahi (Laboratory of the Physics of Biological Systems, LPBS), in the format of .tif;
2. Evaluation Dataset:
